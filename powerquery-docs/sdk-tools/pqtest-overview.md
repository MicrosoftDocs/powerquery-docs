PQTest is the test harness that contains the commands and options to run tests, set credentials, perform regression testing, generate diagnostics, and so on. PQTest.exe is present in the "Microsoft.PowerQuery.SdkTools" NuGet package, which is wrapped by the Power Query SDK Visual Studio Code extension.
