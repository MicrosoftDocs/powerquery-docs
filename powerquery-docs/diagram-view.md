# Diagram view

Diagram view offers a visual way to prepare data in the Power Query editor. With this interface, you can easily create queries and visualize the data preparation process. Diagram view simplifies the experience of getting started with data wrangling. It speeds up the data preparation process and helps you quickly understand the dataflow, both the "big picture view" of how queries are related and the "detailed view" of the specific data preparation steps in a query.

This article provides an overview of the capabilities provided by diagram view.

## Authoring queries using diagram view

Diagram view provides you with a visual interface to create, view, or modify your queries. In diagram view, you can connect to many different types of data sources using the [get data experience](get-data-experience.md).

Diagram view is also connected to the Data Preview and the ribbon so that you can select columns in the Data Preview.

You can add a new step within a query, after the currently selected step, by selecting the **+** button, and then either search for the transform or choose the item from the shortcut menu. These are the same transforms you'll find in the Power Query editor ribbon.

![Example of using the + icon in a query to add a new step in the query.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-plus-sign.png)

By searching and selecting the transform from the shortcut menu, the step gets added to the query, as shown in the following image.

![Remove duplicates transform added through the use of the + icon in the query when in the diagram view.](media/diagram-view/step-added-from-diagram-view.png)

## Query level actions

You can perform two quick actions on a query&mdash;*expand/collapse* a query and *highlight related queries*. These quick actions show up on an active selected query or when hovering over a query.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-query-quick-actions.png" alt-text="Example of quick action buttons in a query as shown in the diagram view.":::

You can perform more query level actions such as duplicate, reference, and so on, by selecting the query level context menu (the three vertical dots). You can also right-click in the query and get to the same context menu.

 :::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-query-more-actions.png" alt-text="More query level actions provided by the query contextual menu by selecting the three vertical dots or by right-clicking the query.":::

### Expand or collapse query

To expand or collapse a query, right-click in the query and select **Expand/Collapse** from the query's context menu. You can also double-click in the query to expand or collapse a query.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-expand-collapse-query.png" alt-text="Emphasizing the collapse button in the context menu of the query.":::

### Highlight related queries

To view all the related queries for a given query, right-click in a query and select **Highlight related queries**. You can also select the highlight related queries button on the top-right of a query.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-highlight-related-queries.png" alt-text="Highlight related queries buttons at the top of the Top US Customers query and inside the context menu.":::

For example, if you select the highlight related queries button in the **Top US Customers** query, you can see that the **Customers** and **Orders** queries are highlighted.  

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-highlight-related-queries-active.png" alt-text="Related queries highlighted for the Top US Customers query inside the diagram view.":::

### Delete query

To delete a query, right-click in a query and select **Delete** from the context menu. There will be an additional pop-up to confirm the deletion.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-delete-query.png" alt-text="Delete option inside the query contextual menu.":::

To rename a query, right-click in a query and select **Rename** from the context menu.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-rename-query.png" alt-text="Rename option inside the query contextual menu.":::

### Enable load

To ensure that the results provided by the query are available for downstream use such as report building, by default **Enable load** is set to true. In case you need to disable load for a given query, right-click in a query and select **Enable load**. The queries where **Enable load** is set to false will be displayed with a grey outline.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-query-enable-load.png" alt-text="Enable load option inside the query contextual menu.":::

### Duplicate

To create a copy of a given query, right-click in the query and select **Duplicate**. A new duplicate query will appear in the diagram view.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-duplicate-query.png" alt-text="Duplicate option inside the query contextual menu.":::

### Reference

Referencing a query will create a new query. The new query will use the steps of the previous query without having to duplicate the query. Additionally, any changes on the original query will transfer down to the referenced query. To reference a query, right-click in the query and select **Reference**.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-reference-query.png" alt-text="Reference option inside the query contextual menu.":::

### Move to group

You can make folders and move the queries into these folders for organizational purposes. These folders are called *groups*. To move a given query to a Query group, right-click in a query and select **Move to group**. You can choose to move the queries to an existing group or create a new query group.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-move-query-to-group.png" alt-text="Move to group option inside the query contextual menu.":::

You can view the query groups above the query box in the diagram view.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-queries-in-group.png" alt-text="Icon and label that specify the group the query has been moved to.":::

### Create function

When you need to apply the same set of transformations in different queries or values, creating custom Power Query *functions* can be valuable. To learn more about custom functions, go to [Using custom functions](./custom-function.md). To convert a query into a reusable function, right-click in a given query and select **Create function**.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-create-function.png" alt-text="Create function option inside the query contextual menu.":::

### Convert to parameter

A parameter provides the flexibility to dynamically change the output of your queries depending on their value and promotes reusability. To convert a non-structured value such as date, text, number, and so on, right-click in the query and select **Convert to Parameter**.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-convert-to-parameter.png" alt-text="Convert to parameter option inside the query contextual menu.":::

>[!NOTE]
> To learn more about how to append queries in Power Query, go to [Append queries](append-queries.md).

### Merge queries/Merge queries as new

To merge or JOIN queries, right-click in a query and select **Merge queries**. This action will display the **Merge** dialog box, with the selected query as the left table of the merge operation. **Merge queries as new** will also display the **Merge** dialog box but will allow you to merge two tables into a new query.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-merge-queries.png" alt-text="Merge queries options inside the query contextual menu.":::

>[!NOTE]
> To learn more about how to merge queries in Power Query, go to [Merge queries overview](merge-queries-overview.md).

## Step level actions

By right-clicking a step, you can perform step level actions such as *Edit settings*, *Rename*, and so on.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-step-settings.png" alt-text="Step level actions displaying in the contextual menu after right clicking a step.":::

You can also perform step level actions by hovering over the step and selecting the ellipsis (three vertical dots).

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-step-settings-ellipsis-button.png" alt-text="Step level actions contextual menu displayed after selecting the ellipsis button.":::

### Edit settings

To edit the step level settings, right-click the step and choose **Edit settings**. Instead, you can double-click the step (that has step settings) and directly get to the settings dialog box. In the settings dialog box, you can view or change the step level settings. For example, the following image shows the settings dialog box for the **Split column** step.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-edit-step-settings.png" alt-text="Settings dialog for the Split column step of a query.":::

![Step properties window for the step with the name 'Filtered rows' and a description that reads 'Filter by US'.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-steps-properties-window.png)

By hovering over each step, you can view a call out that shows the step label, step name, and step descriptions (that were added).

![Descriptions shown at the step level for the steps with the names 'Choose columns' and 'Filter rows' in the Customers query.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-step-descriptions.gif)

By selecting each step, you can see the corresponding data preview for that step.

## Expand and collapse queries

To ensure that you can view your queries in the diagram view, you can collapse the ones that you aren't actively working on and expand the ones that you care about. Expand or collapse queries by selecting the **Expand/Collapse** button on the top-right of a query. Alternatively, double-clicking an expanded query will collapse the query and vice-versa.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-collapse-query.png" alt-text="Collapse button on the top right corner of the query in the diagram view.":::

You can also expand or collapse a query by selecting the query level actions from the query's context menu.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-collapse-query-from-context-menu.png" alt-text="Collapse button inside the query context menu after right-clicking the query.":::

To expand all or collapse all queries, select the **Expand all/Collapse all** button next to the layout options in the diagram view pane.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-collapse-all-queries-button.png" alt-text="Expand all/collapse all queries button at the bottom right-hand corner of the diagram view pane next to the layout options.":::

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-right-click.png" alt-text="Contextual menu after right-clicking any empty space in the diagram view pane that showcases the expand all and collapse all queries options.":::

In the collapsed mode, you can quickly look at the steps in the query by hovering over the number of steps in the query. You can select these steps to navigate to that specific step within the query.  

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-collapsed-queries.png" alt-text="Callout showing the available steps in the Customers query after hovering over the number of steps label in the query.":::

## Layout Options

There are five layout options available in the diagram view: zoom out, zoom in, mini-map, full screen, fit to view, and reset.

### Zoom out/zoom in

With this option, you can adjust the zoom level and zoom out or zoom in to view all the queries in the diagram view.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-zoom.png" alt-text="Zoom out or zoom in button available at the bottom right-hand corner of the diagram view pane.":::

### Mini-map

With this option, you can turn the diagram view mini-map on or off. More information: [Show mini-map](#show-mini-map)

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/show-mini-map-button.png" alt-text="Mini-map button available at the bottom right-hand corner of the diagram view pane.":::

### Full screen

With this option, you can view all the queries and their relationships through the *Full screen* mode. The diagram view pane expands to full screen and the data preview pane, queries pane, and steps pane remain collapsed.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-full-screen.png" alt-text="Full screen button available at the bottom right-hand corner of the diagram view pane.":::

### Fit to view

With this option, you can adjust the zoom level so that all the queries and their relationships can be fully viewed in the diagram view.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-fit-to-view.png" alt-text="Fit to view button available at the bottom right hand corner of the diagram view pane.":::

### Reset

With this option, you can reset the zoom level back to 100% and also reset the pane to the top-left corner.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-reset-view.png" alt-text="Reset button available at the bottom right-hand corner of the diagram view pane.":::

## View query relationships

To view all the related queries for a given query, select the **Highlight related queries** button. For instance, by selecting the highlight related queries button in the **Top US Customers** query, the **Customers** and **Orders** queries are highlighted, as shown in the following image.  

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-highlight-related-queries-sample.png" alt-text="Related queries to the Top US Customers (Orders and Customers) are highlighted with a light blue background color after selecting the highlight related queries button in the Top US Customers query.":::

You can also select the dongle on the left of a given query to see the direct and indirect referenced queries.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-highlight-related-queries-sample-dongle.png" alt-text="Related queries to the Top US Customers (Orders and Customers) are highlighted with a light blue background color after selecting the small dongle on the left of the Top US Customers query.":::

Similarly, you can select the right dongle to view direct and indirect dependent queries.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-highlight-related-queries-direct-indirect-dependent-queries.png" alt-text="Callout displays the direct dependent queries and the indirect dependent queries after selecting the right dongle of the Customers query.":::

You can also hover on the link icon below a step to view a callout that shows the query relationships.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-hover-link-icon.png" alt-text="Referenced queries are listed in a callout after hovering over the link icon below a step.":::

## Diagram view settings

There are two ways to modify diagram view settings. The first way is to select the lower half of the **Diagram View** button inside the **View** tab in the ribbon.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-settings.png" alt-text="Callout displays diagram view settings after opening from the diagram view button.":::

The second way to modify diagram view settings is to right-click over a blank part of the diagram view background.

![Screenshot displays diagram view setting after right-clicking over blank part of the background.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-settings-2.png)

### Step labels and step names

We show **step labels** by default within the diagram view.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-step-labels.png" alt-text="Step labels are displayed in diagram view.":::

You can change diagram view settings to show **step names** to match the **applied steps** within the **query settings** pane.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-step-names.png" alt-text="Step names are displayed in diagram view.":::

### Auto-highlight related queries

By selecting **Auto-highlight related queries** within diagram view settings, related queries are always highlighted so that you can visually see the query dependencies better

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-auto-highlight-related-queries.png" alt-text="Diagram view showing a light blue highlight for queries which are related to each other.":::

### Compact view

When you have queries with multiple steps, it can be challenging to scroll horizontally to view all your steps within the viewport.

![Diagram view showing a query with many steps, requiring a low zoom level to view all the steps.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-compact-view.png)

To address this, diagram view offers **Compact view**, which compresses the steps from top to bottom instead of left to right. This view can be especially useful when you have queries with multiple steps, so that you can see as many queries as possible within the viewport.

![Diagram view showing a query in compact view, where steps are displayed top to bottom instead of left to right.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-compact-view-activated.png)

To enable this view, navigate to diagram view settings and select **Compact view** inside the **View** tab in the ribbon.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/diagram-view-compact-view-settings.png" alt-text="Diagram view settings with compact view selection in a red box.":::

### Show mini-map

Once the number of queries begin to overflow the diagram view, you can use the scroll bars at the bottom and right side of the diagram view to scroll through the queries. One other method of scrolling is to use the diagram view mini-map control. The mini-map control lets you keep track of the overall dataflow "map", and quickly navigate, while looking at an specific area of the map in the main diagram view area.

To open the mini-map, either select **Show mini-map** from the diagram view menu or select the mini-map button in the layout options.

![Diagram view settings with Compact view selected, and the mini-map displayed on the right side.](media/diagram-view/show-mini-map.png)

Right-click and hold the rectangle on the mini-map, then move the rectangle to move around in the diagram view.

### Show animations

When the **Show animations** menu item is selected, the transitions of the sizes and positions of the queries is animated. These transitions are easiest to see when collapsing or expanding the queries or when changing the dependencies of existing queries. When cleared, the transitions will be immediate. Animations are turned on by default.

:::image type="content" source="media/diagram-view/show-animations.gif" alt-text="Animation showing the difference between Show animations being selected or being cleared.":::

## Maximize data preview

You may want to see more data within the data preview to understand and analyze the data. To do so, expand the data preview so that you can see as much data as before within the data preview without leaving diagram View.

![In the data preview, a red box around an up and down arrow in the top left to expand the data preview.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-maximize-data-preview.jpg)

## Expand or collapse all queries

By default, the queries within diagram view are collapsed. There are options to expand or collapse each query in a single click.

![In diagram view, a button and tooltip to expand all queries in the bottom right of diagram view.](media/diagram-view/data-preview-expand-queries.png)

You can also expand or collapse related queries from the query level context menu.

![In diagram view's query level context menu, a red box around options to expand or collapse related queries.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-expand-or-collapse-queries.jpg)

## Multi-select queries

You select multiple queries within the diagram view by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking queries. Once you multi-select, right-clicking will show a context menu that allows performing operations such as merge, append, move to group, expand/collapse and more.

![In diagram view, three queries highlighted in light blue signifying that they have been multi-selected, with a context menu in a red box displaying different operations.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-multi-select.png)

## Inline rename

You can double-click the query name to rename the query.

![In diagram view, showing how double clicking the query name will make the name editable.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-inline-rename.jpg)

Double-clicking the step name allows you to rename the step, provided the diagram view setting is showing step names.

![In the diagram view, showing how double clicking the step name will name the name editable.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-rename-step.jpg)

When step labels are displayed in diagram view, double-clicking the step label shows the dialog box to rename the step name and provide a description.

![In the diagram view, showing a modal where step properties and description can be edited.](media/diagram-view/diagram-view-rename-step-label.jpg)
