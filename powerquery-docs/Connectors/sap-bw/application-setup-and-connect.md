>[!Note]
> Some capabilities may be present in one product but not others due to deployment schedules and host-specific capabilities.

## Prerequisites

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Version 1.0 of the SAP BW Application Server connector is deprecated. You should begin using only Implementation 2.0 of the SAP BW Application Server connector. All support for version 1.0 will be removed from the connector in the near future.

You'll need an SAP account to sign in to the website and download the drivers. If you're unsure, contact the SAP administrator in your organization. The drivers need to be installed on the gateway machine.

You can use either version 1.0 of the SAP Business Warehouse (BW) Application Server connector or the Implementation 2.0 SAP connector in Power Query Desktop. The following sections describe the installation of each version, in turn. You can choose one or the other connector when connecting to an SAP BW Application Server from Power BI Desktop.

BW 7.3, BW 7.5 and BW/4HANA 2.0 is supported.

>[!NOTE]
>We suggest you use the Implementation 2.0 SAP connector whenever possible because it provides significant performance, functionality, and reliability improvements over 1.0.

>[!NOTE]
> Power Query Online requires both version 1.0 and version 2.0 SAP BW connectors on the Power BI gateway if one is being used. This means both the SAP NetWeaver SDK library and the SAP .NET Connector must be installed on the gateway machine.

### Prerequisites for version 1.0

To use version 1.0 of the SAP BW Application Server connector, you must install the *SAP NetWeaver* library on your local computer. You can get the SAP NetWeaver library from your SAP administrator or directly from the [SAP Software Download Center](https://support.sap.com/swdc). Since the SAP Software Download Center changes its structure frequently, more specific guidance for navigating that site isn't available. The SAP NetWeaver library is usually included in the SAP Client Tools installation.

You can search for *SAP Note #1025361* to get the download location for the most recent version. Make sure the architecture for the SAP NetWeaver library (32-bit or 64-bit) matches your Power BI Desktop installation. Install all files included in the *SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK* according to the SAP Note.

### Prerequisites for version 2.0

To use the version 2.0 SAP BW Application Server connector in Power BI Desktop or Power Query Online, you must install the SAP .NET Connector 3.0. Access to the download requires a valid S-user. Contact your SAP Basis team to get the SAP .NET Connector 3.0. You can download the [SAP .NET Connector 3.0](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/msnet.html) from SAP. The connector comes in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Choose the version that matches your Power BI Desktop installation. For Power Query Online, choose the 64-bit version. Currently, the website lists two versions for .NET 4.0 framework:

* SAP Connector for Microsoft .NET 3.0.23.0 for Windows 32 bit (x86) as a zip file (6,928 KB), May 28, 2020
* SAP Connector for Microsoft .NET 3.0.23.0 for Windows 64 bit (x64) as a zip file (7,225 KB), May 28, 2020

## Connect to an SAP BW Application Server from Power Query Desktop

To connect to an SAP BW Application Server:

1. From the **Home** tab of Power BI Desktop, select **Get Data > SAP Business Warehouse Application Server**.

2. Enter the server name, system number, and client ID of the SAP BW Application Server you want to connect to. This example uses `SAPBWTestServer` as the server name, a system number of `00`, and a client ID of `837`.

    The rest of this example describes how to import your data into Power Query Desktop, which is the default setting for **Data Connectivity mode**. If you want to use DirectQuery to load your data, see [Connect to SAP Business Warehouse by using DirectQuery in Power BI](/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-directquery-sap-bw).

    This example also uses the default **Implementation** of **2.0 (requires SAP .NET Connector 3.0)**. If you want to use version 1 of the SAP BW Application Server connector, select **1.0 (requires NetWeaver RFC)**.

    If you want to use any of the advanced options for this connector to fine-tune your query, go to [Use advanced options](use-advanced-options.md).

    When you've finished filling in the relevant information, select **OK**.

3. When accessing the database for the first time, the SAP BW Application Server requires database user credentials. Power Query Desktop offers two authentication modes for SAP BW connections&mdash;user name/password authentication (Database), and Windows authentication (single sign-on). SAML authentication isn't currently supported. Select either **Windows** or **Database**. If you select **Database** authentication, enter your user name and password. If you select **Windows** authentication, go to [Windows Authentication and single sign-on](single-sign-on.md) to learn more about the requirements for Windows authentication.

   ![Enter the server credentials.](sign-in-app.png)

   Then select **Connect**.

   For more information about authentication, go to [Authentication with a data source](../../connectorauthentication.md).

4. From the **Navigator** dialog box, select the items you want to use. When you select one or more items from the server, the **Navigator** dialog box creates a preview of the output table. For more information about navigating the SAP BW Application Server query objects in Power Query, go to [Navigate the query objects](navigate-query-objects.md).

## Connect using router strings

SAP router is an SAP program that acts as an intermediate station (proxy) in a network connection between SAP systems, or between SAP systems and external networks. SAP router controls the access to your network, and, as such, is a useful enhancement to an existing firewall system (port filter). Figuratively, the firewall forms an impenetrable "wall" around your network. However, since some connections need to penetrate this wall, a "gate" has to be made in the firewall. SAP router assumes control of this gate. In short, SAP router provides you with the means of controlling access to your SAP system.

## Router strings in Power Query

To establish a connection to an SAP BW system through an SAP router, you can use router strings in place of the server name in the Power Query connection settings.

The syntax used for the router string is:

`<SAP router 1><SAP router 2>.....<SAP router n><destination : application server>`

Where:

* `<SAP router>` = `/H/<sap router host name>/S/<sap router port>`
* `<destination> = /H/<application server host name>/S/<application server port or service name>`

>[!NOTE]
>`/S/<port>` can be omitted if the port is the default port (3299).

The following table contains examples of some router strings.

| Destination | Example | Router string |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------- |
| Application Server | FQDN for application server | `/H/saprouter-maq/S/3299/H/bwmpas.mycompany.com/S/3214` |
| Application Server | SAP Router port provided | `/H/saprouter-maq/S/3299/H/bwmpas/S/3214` |
| Application Server | SAP Router port omitted | `/H/10.11.23.33/H/bwmpas/S/3214` |

## Considerations

* Router strings can include passwords, prefixed by either `/P/` or `/W/`. Passwords aren't supported in Power Query router strings as this could be unsafe. Using a password will result in an error.

* Router strings also allow the use of symbolic SAP system names, prefixed with `/R/`. This type of string isn't supported in Power Query.

* In Power Query, you can use the "router string" syntax to specify a custom port, so router strings with a single station are allowed. Router strings can then be identified as starting with either `/H/` or `/M/`. Any other input is assumed to be a server name/IP address.
