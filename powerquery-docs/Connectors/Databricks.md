## Prerequisites

This connector is for use with a Databricks SQL Warehouse running on either AWS or GCP and using OAuth. If you are using Azure Databricks, use the "Azure Databricks" connector. Databricks Community Edition is not supported.

## Capabilities supported

* Import
* DirectQuery (PowerBI only)

## Connect to Databricks (AWS or GCP) from Power Query Desktop

To connect to Databricks from Power Query Desktop, take the following steps:

1. In the Get Data experience, search for **databricks** to shortlist the Databrick connectors: "Azure Databricks" and "Databricks (beta)". You are to use the "Databricks" connector here for your Databricks SQL Warehouse (running on either AWS or GCP) when you are using OAuth for authentication.

2. You will provide the "Server hostname" and "HTTP Path" for your Databricks SQL Warehouse. Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi#get-server-hostname-port-http-path-and-jdbc-url) for instructions to look up your "Server hostname" and "HTTP Path". Enter these accordingly. You may optionally supply a default catalog and/or database under **Advanced options**. Select **OK** to continue.

3. You will need provide your credentials to authenticate with your Databricks SQL Warehouse. You have 3 options for credentials:

    1. Username / Password. This option is not available if your organization/account uses 2FA/MFA. 
    2. Personal Access Token. Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/user/security/personal-access-tokens) for instructions on generating a Personal Access Token (PAT).
    3. OAuth (OIDC). Sign into your organizational account via the browser popup.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Once you enter your credentials for a particular **Databricks** SQL Warehouse, Power BI Desktop caches and reuses those same credentials in subsequent connection attempts. You can modify those credentials by going to **File > Options and settings > Data source settings**. More information: [Change the authentication method](../ConnectorAuthentication.md#change-the-authentication-method)

4. Once you successfully connect, the **Navigator** window shows the data available to you on the cluster. You can choose to either **Transform Data** to transform the data using Power Query or **Load** to load the data in Power Query Desktop.

## Connect to Databricks data from Power Query Online

To connect to Databricks from Power Query Online, take the following steps:

1. In the Get Data experience, select the **Dataflow** category. (Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-create) for instructions.) Shortlist the available Databricks connectors with the Search box. Select the "Databricks" connector for your Databricks SQL Warehouse.

2. Enter the "Server hostname" and "HTTP Path" for your Databricks SQL Warehouse. Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi#get-server-hostname-port-http-path-and-jdbc-url) for instructions to look up your "Server hostname" and "HTTP Path". You may optionally supply a default catalog and/or database under **Advanced options**.

3. You will also provide your credentials to authenticate with your Databricks SQL Warehouse. There are three options for credentials:

    1. Basic. Use this option when authenticating with user name/password. This option is not available if your organization/account uses 2FA/MFA. 
    2. Account Key. Use this option when authenticating using a Personal Access Token. Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/user/security/personal-access-tokens) for instructions on generating a Personal Access Token (PAT).
    3. Organizational account. Use this option when authenticating with OAuth. Sign into your organizational account via the browser popup.

4. Once you successfully connect, a **Navigator** window appears and displays the data available on the server. Select your data in the navigator. Then select **Next** to transform the data in Power Query.
