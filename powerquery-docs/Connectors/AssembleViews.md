2. In **Assemble Views**, enter your site's URL to sign in. For example, use **`https://example.tryassemble.com`**.

   Once you've successfully signed in, select **Connect**.

4. In the **Navigator** dialog box, select the Assemble Views that you want to load. For each project, there's a single item for view images named **[Your Project] View Thumbnails**. Select this option if you want to include images in your report. Select **Transform Data** to continue to Power Query.

   b. Select **Close & Apply** to load the datasets.

6. (Optional) If you have chosen to load images, you'll need to update the **Data category** for the image field.

   a. Expand the **[Your Project] View Thumbnails** table, and then select the **Image** field.  This selection opens the **Column tools** tab.

   b. Open the **Data category** drop-down and select **Image URL**. You can now drag and drop the Image field into your report visuals.

## Known issues and limitations

* Views with greater than 100,000 rows may not load depending on the number of fields included in the view. To avoid this limitation, we suggest breaking large views into multiple smaller views and appending the queries in your report, or creating relationships in your data model.

* The **view images** feature currently only supports thumbnail sized images because of a row size limitation in Power BI.
