## Connect to Amazon Redshift data from Power Query Desktop

To connect to Amazon Redshift data:

1. Select the **Amazon Redshift** option in the **Get Data** selection.

2. In **Server**, enter the server name where your data is located. As part of the Server field, you can also specify a port in the following format: *ServerURL:Port*. In **Database**, enter the name of the Amazon Redshift database you want to access. In this example, `contoso.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439` is the server name and port number, `dev` is the database name, and **Data Connectivity mode** is set to **Import**.

    You can also choose some optional advanced options for your connection. More information: [Connect using advanced options](#connect-using-advanced-options)

    After you have finished filling in and selecting all the options you need, select **OK**.

3. If this is the first time you're connecting to this database, enter your credentials in the **User name** and **Password** boxes of the Amazon Redshift authentication type. Then select **Connect**.

## Connect using advanced options

Power Query provides a set of advanced options that you can add to your query if needed.

The following table describes all of the advanced options you can set in Power Query.

| Advanced option | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Provider Name | Provides an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), which uniquely identifies AWS resources. |
| Batch size | Specifies the maximum number of rows to retrieve at a time from the server when fetching data. A small number translates into more calls to the server when retrieving a large data set. A large number of rows may improve performance, but could cause high memory usage. The default value is 100 rows. |
| SQL Statement | For information, go to [Import data from a database using native database query](../native-database-query.md). This option is only available in Power BI Desktop. |

## Enable Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On (SSO) for Amazon Redshift

We support Microsoft Entra ID SSO through both Power BI Service (cloud) and also through the on-premises data gateway. For more information about enabling Microsoft Entra ID SSO for all connectors, go to [Overview of single sign-on (SSO) for on-premises data gateways in Power BI](/power-bi/connect-data/service-gateway-sso-overview).

### Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On (SSO) through Power BI service

To configure a new connection in Power BI service:

1. In Power BI service, select **Admin portal** from the settings list.

   ![Image of the setting menu opened, with the Admin portal emphasized.](./media/amazon-redshift/admin-portal.png)

2. Enable the **Redshift SSO** option.

### Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On (SSO) for Amazon Redshift with an on-premises data gateway

Before you can enable Microsoft Entra ID SSO for Amazon Redshift, you must first enable Microsoft Entra ID SSO for all data sources that support Microsoft Entra ID SSO with an on-premises data gateway:

1. In Power BI service, select **Admin portal** from the settings list.
