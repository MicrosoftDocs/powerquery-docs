## Snowflake connector implementation 2.0

In January 2025, we introduced a new implementation for the Snowflake connector to enhance the integration with Snowflake. This connector has been generally available since July 2025. You're recommended to upgrade the Power BI Desktop and on-premises data gateway to the latest version to benefit from the most current capabilities. [Provide us feedback](https://aka.ms/snowflake-connector-feedback) to help us continue improving the connector.

The Snowflake connector implementation 2.0 is built using the open-source [Arrow Database Connectivity](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/ADBC.html) (ADBC) driver. ADBC provides a set of standard interfaces for interacting with Arrow data, which is especially efficient at fetching large datasets with minimal overhead and no serialization or copying. The ADBC driver also incorporates security enhancements such as memory safety and garbage collection. Additionally, collaboration with the open-source community enables more rapid updates, utilizing modern tools and secure development lifecycle (SDL) processes.

To enable you to take advantage of these performance and security enhancements, starting July 2025, all the newly created connections automatically uses the 2.0 implementation. In addition, we'll gradually transition existing customers to the 2.0 implementation in phases, with updates being applied to different regions through November 2025. During this period, you can test the 2.0 implementation by updating your existing queries and adding the `Implementation="2.0"` flag in `Snowflake.Databases` as follows. After the transition, connections that do not specify an implementation will be automatically updated to the 2.0 implementation.

```powerquery-m
Source = Snowflake.Databases("contoso.snowflakecomputing.com", "CONTOSO_WH", [Implementation="2.0"])
```

To aid with diagnosing any potential issue, you can find the `Implementation` and `DriverType` details in your Mashup logs like the following example. If you encounter any issue during the transition, contact support. Meanwhile, to self-mitigate, you can specify `Implementation="1.0"` to keep using the 1.0 connector to avoid business interruption before the issue is resolved.

```json
{"Start":"2024-11-02T00:14:02.7968686Z","Action":"Engine/Module/Snowflake/IO/Snowflake/Implementation","ResourceKind":"Snowflake","ResourcePath":"powerbi.snowflakecomputing.com ;DEMO_WH","HostProcessId":"29200","Implementation":"2.0","DriverType":"ADBC","ProductVersion":"2.139.0.0 (Main)+eda56ecd858054173a4d11db9c63a6da5cf92a99","ActivityId":"106f16b6-cfbb-4853-9f20-ed45486486d2","Process":"Microsoft.Mashup.Container.NetFX45","Pid":38560,"Tid":1,"Duration":"00:00:00.0000291"}
```

The following options are available since July 2025 release:

- `UseHighPrecision`: Controls the precision of how Snowflake NUMBER(38,0) fields should be handled. If no value is specified, the connector queries Snowflake using the `SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'ODBC_TREAT_DECIMAL_AS_INT'` query. If the no value is set, then the connector uses the scale specified by the column. A `true` value treats NUMBER(38,0) as a Decimal type. The value `false` treats NUMBER(38,0) as an Int64 type. If the scale is higher than 0, then the column is considered as a Double type. 
- `DateTimePrecision`: Controls the precision of how Snowflake Timestamp values are treated. Snowflake typically stores Timestamp values with nanosecond precision. In ADBC, this can cause an overflow exception for dates before 1677 or after 2262, [according to Snowflake](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Arrow_batches). Valid values for this option are *null*, `nanoseconds` or `microseconds`. A *null* value uses `nanoseconds` by default. Users who need dates before 1677 or after 2262 are recommended to use the `microseconds` setting. If users need to retain precision to the ten millionth place before 1677 or after 2262, it's recommended to stay with the ODBC driver.

If you need to use proxy to connect to Snowflake, refer to the [proxy setting instruction](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Proxy). The driver uses environment variables for the proxy settings.

Below is a summary of the connector enhancement released in the past versions:

| Release       | Connector improvement                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| July 2025     | \- Boolean columns return Boolean types, fixing the issue where Boolean columns were treated as String types in an empty record set schema (including metadata).<br/>- New setting to set the maximum timestamp precision to microseconds.<br/>- Improved Duration support.<br/>- Added support for navigation properties to ADBC.<br/>- Improved tracing in the ADBC driver, where the â€œActivityId" can now be traced through the driver layer. |
| April 2025    | - Added support for Snowflake query tag. As an example: `{"PowerQuery":true,"Host":"PBI_SemanticModel_MWC","HostContext":"PowerBIPremium-DirectQuery"}` |
| March 2025    | - Enhanced performance when retrieving data from Snowflake.<br/>- Enabled by default in Power BI Desktop so that the newly created connections automatically use the new connector implementation.<br/>- Fixed the [views not visible issue](#views-not-visible-with-implementation20) since the latest March release. |
| February 2025 | - Enhanced performance by reducing the number of metadata calls.<br/>- Resolved duplicate values issue for large result sets. |

> [!NOTE]
> When you use the on-premises data gateway, note the minimal supported version is January 2025. You're recommended to use the latest version with the most current capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is supported in the 64-bit version of Power BI Desktop and doesn't work in the 32-bit version.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: SQL compilation error: Object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed

The error occurs when the system can't find the specified object. Often, this error is due to the user having an invalid database name set as their default database.

Ensure that a valid default database name is used for the property DEFAULT_NAMESPACE:
 `DESC USER`*`username`*

To update the default database name: `alter user`*`username`*` set DEFAULT_NAMESPACE=<database name>.<schema name>`. For more information, see the Snowflake documentation - https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-user

## Limitations and known issues

### Known issues in Snowflake connector implementation 2.0

Currently, the [Snowflake connector implementation 2.0](#snowflake-connector-implementation-20) has the following known issues. There's ongoing work towards a fix and the documentation will be updated when a fix is released.

- Snowflake query with `count distinct` logic returns incorrect result. 
- When creating relationships, encounter error `Object reference not set to an instance of an object`. The relationship can still be defined once you cancel the pop-up window.

### Resolved issues

#### Hyphens in database names

If a database name has a hyphen in it, you can encounter an ```ODBC: ERROR[42000] SQL compilation error```. This issue is addressed in the September 2024 release.

#### Slicer visual for Boolean datatype

The slicer visual for the Boolean data type isn't functioning as expected in the June 2024 release. This nonfunctionality is a known issue. As a temporary solution, users can convert the Boolean data type in their reports to text by navigating to: Transfer -> Data Type -> Text. A fix is provided in October 2024 release.

#### Views not visible with Implementation="2.0"

In some version of March 2025 release of Power BI Desktop, you may encounter issue that views are not visible when using the [Snowflake connector implementation 2.0](#snowflake-connector-implementation-20) (`Implementation="2.0"`). This issue has been fixed since the latest March 2025 release of Power BI Desktop. Upgrade your installation to try again.

#### TIMESTAMP_NTZ values are UTC with Implementation="2.0"

TIMESTAMP_LTZ types are not being converted to the local time zone but are returning the UTC value when using the [Snowflake connector implementation 2.0](#snowflake-connector-implementation-20) (`Implementation="2.0"`). For example, doing `SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` from Snowflake is returning the UTC time, not the user's local time zone. This issue is addressed in the July 2025 release.

#### Index was outside the bounds of the array when using Implementation="2.0"

In some scenarios, an error is thrown indicating the `Index was outside the bounds of the array` when using the [Snowflake connector implementation 2.0](#snowflake-connector-implementation-20) (`Implementation="2.0"`). This issue is addressed in the June 2025 release.
