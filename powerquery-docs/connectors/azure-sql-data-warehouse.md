:::image type="content" source="./media/azure-sql-database/advanced-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the advanced options available for the connector in Power Query.":::

The following table lists all of the advanced options you can set in Power Query Desktop and Power Query Online.

| Advanced option | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Command timeout in minutes | If your connection lasts longer than 10 minutes (the default timeout), you can enter another value in minutes to keep the connection open longer. |
| SQL statement | For information, go to [Import data from a database using native database query](../native-database-query.md). |
| Include relationship columns | If checked, includes columns that might have relationships to other tables. If this box is cleared, you donâ€™t see those columns. |
| Navigate using full hierarchy | If checked, the navigator displays the complete hierarchy of tables in the database you're connecting to. If cleared, the navigator displays only the tables whose columns and rows contain data. |
| Enable SQL Server Failover support | If checked, when a node in the Azure SQL [failover group](/azure/azure-sql/database/auto-failover-group-overview?tabs=azure-powershell) isn't available, Power Query moves from that node to another when failover occurs. If cleared, no failover occurs. |
| Enable cross database folding | This option is only available in Power Query Online. |

Once you select the advanced options you require, select **OK** in Power Query Desktop or **Next** in Power Query Online to connect to Azure Synapse Analytics.
