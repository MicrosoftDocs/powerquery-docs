## Prerequisites

It is assumed that a Dynatrace environment is already configured for
connection from Power BI Desktop.

On Microsoft Azure, that can be done through the Marketplace and
searching for **Azure Native Dynatrace Service**.

Follow the instructions to set up a Dynatrace SaaS environment. Make
sure the environment is set to the new version and not the previous classic version,
as the latest version contains the Dynatrace Grail data lakehouse and is set up for
the authentication requirements for the connector.

## Capabilities Supported

- Import mode only
- Option to enter a DQL query when connecting - limited to a maximum of 1 million rows

## Connection to Dynatrace Grail from Power BI Desktop

To connect to a Dynatrace SaaS instance from Power Query Desktop, take the following steps:

1. Select **Dynatrace Grail DQL** in the get data experience. For more information, go to [Where to get data](../where-to-get-data.md).

2. Enter your Dynatrace environment. This environment needs to be the latest Dynatrace version with Grail enabled. The DQL query is optional at this point, but should be used for more complex queries outside of the default built in queries.

3. Sign into your environment to authenticate your permissions.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/dynatrace-grail-dql/connector4-white.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Power Query authentication dialog when you sign in.":::

4. A browser window pops up that requires you to enter your credentials.

5. Once you have successfully authenticated, the message shows that you're currently signed in. Select **Connect**.

6. The Navigator screen shows the record types available to select from Dynatrace Grail.

7. Selecting one of them logs in this example, and runs a fetch logs DQL query with a default 1000 row limit. You require permissions on the Dynatrace environment in order to run this query successfully.

8. The advanced editor shows the M code the connector is using.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/dynatrace-grail-dql/connector9-white.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the connector in M code.":::

9.  An optional step when connecting is to type in a DQL query directly. The following example fetches logs (default last 2 hours) with a limit of 1000 rows.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/dynatrace-grail-dql/connector10-white.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sample DQL query that can be used in the connector.":::

10. The resulting import into Power BI looks similar to this example.

### Troubleshooting

- The latest version ("New" not "Classic") of Dynatrace SaaS is required.

- The correct permissions outlined in [Dynatrace documentation](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/platform/grail/data-model/assign-permissions-in-grail) are required to be able to:

  - Connect to the environment
  - Run DQL queries against the Dynatrace platform
