## Connect to SQL Server database from Power Query Desktop

To make the connection, take the following steps:

1. Select the **SQL Server database** option in the connector selection.

2. In the **SQL Server database** dialog that appears, provide the name of the server and database (optional).

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sql-server-database/select-database-desktop.png" alt-text="SQL Server database connection builder in Power Query Desktop.":::

3. Select either the **Import** or **DirectQuery** data connectivity mode (Power BI Desktop only).

4. Select **OK**.

5. If you're connecting to this database for the first time, select the authentication type, input your credentials, and select the level to apply the authentication settings to. Then select **Connect**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the connection isn't encrypted, you'll be prompted with the following dialog.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sql-server-database/encryption-warning.png" alt-text="SQL Server database encryption support.":::

    Select **OK** to connect to the database by using an unencrypted connection, or follow these [instructions](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-encrypted-connections-to-the-database-engine) to set up encrypted connections to SQL Server. Additionally, when encryption is enabled for SQL servers using self-signed certificates, review this [section](#sql-server-certificate-isnt-trusted-on-the-client-power-bi-desktop-or-on-premises-data-gateway) to add the SQL servers to the Power Query Desktop client's trust list.

6. In **Navigator**, select the database information you want, then either select **Load** to load the data or **Transform Data** to continue transforming the data in Power Query Editor.

## Connect to SQL Server database from Power Query Online

To make the connection, take the following steps:

1. Select the **SQL Server database** option in the connector selection.

2. In the **SQL Server database** dialog that appears, provide the name of the server and database (optional).

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sql-server-database/select-database-online.png" alt-text="SQL Server database connection builder in Power Query Online.":::

3. If the SQL server isn't online, select an on-premises data gateway. Additionally, if using the port with servername, use the value `servername*` as the server name in the connection settings.

4. If you're connecting to this database for the first time, select the authentication kind and input your credentials.

5. If the connection isn't encrypted, and the connection dialog contains a **Use Encrypted Connection** check box, clear the check box.

6. Select **Next** to continue.

7. In **Navigator**, select the data you require, and then select **Transform data**.

## Connect using advanced options

Both Power Query Desktop and Power Query Online provide a set of advanced options that you can add to your query if needed. The following table lists all of the advanced options you can set in Power Query Desktop and Power Query Online.

| Advanced option | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Command timeout in minutes | If your connection lasts longer than 10 minutes (the default timeout), you can enter another value in minutes to keep the connection open longer. This option is only available in Power Query Desktop. |
| SQL statement | For information, go to [Import data from a database using native database query](../native-database-query.md). |
| Include relationship columns | If checked, includes columns that might have relationships to other tables. If this box is cleared, you can't see those columns. |
| Navigate using full hierarchy | If checked, the Navigator displays the complete hierarchy of tables in the database you're connecting to. If cleared, Navigator displays only the tables whose columns and rows contain data. |
| Enable SQL Server Failover support | If checked, when a node in the SQL Server [failover group](/sql/sql-server/failover-clusters/windows/windows-server-failover-clustering-wsfc-with-sql-server) isn't available, Power Query moves from that node to another when failover occurs. If cleared, no failover occurs. |

Once you select the advanced options you require, select **OK** in Power Query Desktop or **Next** in Power Query Online to connect to your SQL Server database.

## Limitations

### SQL Server certificate isn't trusted on the client (Power BI Desktop or on-premises data gateway)

When establishing a connection to an on-premises SQL Server using the on-premises data gateway or Power BI Desktop and the SQL Server utilizes a self-signed certificate, it's possible that the refresh operation for a Fabric semantic model or dataflow can fail with the following error message:

```Microsoft SQL: A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. (provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.)```

To troubleshoot this error when using on-premises data gateway, change the gateway configurations to update the `SqlTrustedServers` setting using the following steps:

1. On the local machine where the on-premises data gateway is installed, navigate to **C:\Program Files\On-premises data gateway**.
2. Make a backup of the configuration file named **Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config**.
3. Open the original **Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config** configuration file and locate the `SqlTrustedServers` entry.
4. Update the `SqlTrustedServers` value with the names of the SQL servers to trust and connect to.

   The value contains a comma-delimited list of server names and supports **\*** as a wild card. So for instance in the following example:

   `<setting name="SqlTrustedServers" serializeAs="String"> <value>contososql*,mysvr</value> </setting>`

   the value `contososql*,mysvr` matches `contososql6`, `contososqlazure`, and `mysvr`, but doesn't match `mysvr.microsoft.com`.

To troubleshoot this error when using Power BI Desktop, modify the value of the environment variable `PBI_SQL_TRUSTED_SERVERS` to include the SQL Servers. The supported values are the same as outlined for gateway configuration (as described in step 4 above).

### Always Encrypted columns

Power Query doesn't support 'Always Encrypted' columns.

### Microsoft Entra ID authentication

Microsoft Entra ID (Organizational account) authentication is only supported in the SQL Server connector if the specified server also supports Microsoft Entra ID authentication. Otherwise, you might encounter a "The OAuth authentication method isn't supported in this data source" error.

Note that in Power BI service, the Microsoft Entra ID authentication method shows up as "OAuth2."
