## Deprecation

> [!NOTE]
> This connector is deprecated because of end of support for the Microsoft Azure Consumption Insights service. We recommend that users transition off existing connections using this connector, and don't use this connector for new connections.

### Transition instructions

Users are instructed to use the certified [Microsoft Azure Cost Management connector](azure-cost-management.md) as a replacement. The table and field names are similar and should offer the same functionality.

### Timeline

The Microsoft Azure Consumption Insights service will stop working in December 2021. Users should transition off the Microsoft Azure Consumption Insights connector to the [Microsoft Azure Cost Management connector](azure-cost-management.md) by December 2021.
