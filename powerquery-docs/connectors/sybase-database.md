## Connect using advanced options

Power Query provides a set of advanced options that you can add to your query if needed.

The following table lists all of the advanced options you can set in Power Query.

| Advanced option | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Command timeout in minutes | If your connection lasts longer than 10 minutes (the default timeout), you can enter another value in minutes to keep the connection open longer. |
| SQL statement | For information, go to [Import data from a database using native database query](../native-database-query.md). |
| Include relationship columns | If checked, includes columns that might have relationships to other tables. If this box is cleared, you wonâ€™t see those columns. |
| Navigate using full hierarchy | If checked, the navigator displays the complete hierarchy of tables in the database you're connecting to. If cleared, the navigator displays only the tables whose columns and rows contain data. |

Once you've selected the advanced options you require, select **OK** in Power Query Desktop or **Next** in Power Query Online to connect to your Sybase database.
