## Prerequisites

If you use Power BI Desktop you need to install the November release of Power BI Desktop or later. [Download the latest version](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58494).

The data provider sends an activation URL from which you can download a credentials file that grants you access to the shared data.

After downloading the credentials file, open it with a text editor to retrieve the endpoint URL and the token.

## Limitations and considerations
