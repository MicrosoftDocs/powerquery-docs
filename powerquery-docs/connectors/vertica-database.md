   For more information about authentication methods, go to [Authentication with a data source](../connectorauthentication.md).

5. After you connect, a **Navigator** window appears and displays the data that's available on the server. Either select **Load** to load the data or **Transform Data** to continue transforming the data in the Power Query editor.


## Connect to a Vertica database from Power Query Online

To connect to an **Vertica** database, take the following steps:

1. Select the **Vertica** option in the connector selection.

2. In **Connect to data source**, provide the name of the server.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/Vertica-database/service-signin.png" alt-text="Enter the Vertica database online connection.":::

3. Select the name of your on-premises data gateway.

4. If this is the first time you're connecting to this Vertica database, configure the user name and password for the Basic authentication.

5. Select **Next** to continue.

6. In **Navigator**, select the data you require, then select **Transform data** to transform the data in the Power Query editor.

## Use Vertica ODBC driver (Preview)

The Vertica connector includes a built-in driver for connectivity by default. Starting from the February 2025 version of Power BI Desktop and the on-premises data gateway, there is an additional option to use the official Vertica ODBC driver to connect to the Vertica database, currently available in preview. This enables you to utilize the native client tool provided by the data source.

To install the driver on the machine running Power BI Desktop or the on-premises data gateway, follow these steps:

1. Download the Windows version of Vertica ODBC driver from [Client Drivers](https://www.vertica.com/download/vertica/client-drivers/).

2. Open the downloaded .exe to begin the installation process.

3. Select **ODBC driver** under **Vertica Component List**, then select **Next** to start the installation.

   :::image type="content" source="media/Vertica-database/install-odbc-driver.png" alt-text="Screenshot of installing the Vertica ODBC driver on local machine.":::

To use this Vertica ODBC driver in Power BI Desktop, navigate to **Options and settings** (under the **File** tab) > **Options** > **Preview features**, and then select the checkbox to enable the **Use user-installed Vertica ODBC driver** option. 

To use this Vertica ODBC driver in the on-premises data gateway, change the gateway configurations to update the `UserInstalledVerticaODBCDriver` setting using the following steps:

1. On the local machine where the on-premises data gateway is installed, navigate to **C:\Program Files\On-premises data gateway**.
2. Make a backup of the configuration file named **Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config**.
3. Open the original **Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config** configuration file and locate the `UserInstalledVerticaODBCDriver` entry.
4. Update the `UserInstalledVerticaODBCDriver` value as `True`.
5. Restart your gateway.

```xml
<Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.GatewayCoreSettings>
   ...
   <setting name="UserInstalledVerticaODBCDriver" serializeAs="String">
	   <value>True</value>
   </setting>
   ...
</Microsoft.PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.GatewayCoreSettings>    
```

The remaining configurations to connect to a Vertica database from Power Query Desktop or Power Query Online are the same as described in the previous sections.
