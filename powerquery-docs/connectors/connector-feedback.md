# Power Query connector feedback

This article describes how to submit feedback for Power Query connectors. It's important to distinguish between Microsoft-owned connectors and non-Microsoft-owned connectors, as the support and feedback channels are different.

To confirm whether a connector is Microsoft-owned, visit the [connector reference](index.md). Only connectors marked as "By Microsoft" are Microsoft-owned connectors.

## Microsoft-owned connectors

This section outlines instructions to receive support or submit feedback on Microsoft-owned connectors.

### Support and troubleshooting

If you're finding an issue with a Power Query connector, use the dedicated support channels for the product you're using Power Query connectors in. For example, for Power BI, visit the [Power BI support page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/).

If you're seeking help with using Microsoft-owned Power Query connectors, visit one of the following resources.

* Community forums for the product you're using Power Query in. For example, for Power BI, this forum would be the [Power BI Community](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Power-Query/bd-p/power-bi-services) and for PowerPlatform dataflows, the forum would be [Power Apps Community](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Power-Query/bd-p/PA_PowerQuery).
* [Power Query website resources](https://powerquery.microsoft.com/resources/).

### Submitting feedback

To submit feedback about a Microsoft-owned connector, provide the feedback to the "ideas" forum for the product you're using Power Query connectors in. For example, for Power BI, visit the [Power BI ideas forum](https://ideas.powerbi.com). If you have one, you can also provide feedback directly to your Microsoft account contact.

## Non-Microsoft-owned connectors

This section outlines instructions to receive support or submit feedback on non-Microsoft-owned connectors.

### Support and troubleshooting

For non-Microsoft-owned connectors, support and troubleshooting questions should go to the connector owner through their support channels. For example, for a Contoso-owned connector, you should submit a request through the Contoso support channels.

You can also engage the Power Query community resources indicated above for Microsoft-owned connectors, in case a member of the community can assist.

### Submitting feedback

As non-Microsoft-owned connectors are managed and updated by the respective connector owner, feedback should be sent directly to the connector owner. For example, to submit feedback about a Contoso-owned connector, you should directly submit feedback to Contoso.
