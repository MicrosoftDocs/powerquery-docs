### Data Refresh options

In Power BI, there are two main options to refresh data to ensure that the latest up-to-date information is available:

* **On-Demand Refresh:** This allows users to manually trigger a refresh of the dataset whenever they need to update the data. This can be done directly from the Power BI Service interface or through the Power BI Desktop application. On-demand refresh is useful when immediate access to the latest data is required, or when the data source does not support scheduled refreshes.

![linkedin-learning-on-demand-refresh](media/linkedin-learning/data-refresh-option-one.png)

* **Scheduled Refresh:** This option allows you to set up a refresh schedule for your dataset in Power BI Service. You can define how often you want the data to be refreshed, such as daily, weekly, or even multiple times per day.

 Scheduled refreshes can be configured to run at specific times or intervals to ensure that the data is always current.

This option is suitable for regularly updated datasets where the data source supports scheduled refresh.

![linkedin-learning-scheduled-refresh](media/linkedin-learning/data-refresh-option-two.png)

#### Data refresh feature in the published dataset

To update the data tables, you can either schedule a refresh or perform an on-demand refresh.

1. Click on the dataset name you wish to refresh.

    ![linkedin-learning-reporting-api-keys-completed](media/linkedin-learning/data-refresh-select-table.png)

2. Select refresh option:
    1. Refresh now
    1. Schedule refresh

![linkedin-learning-reporting-api-keys-completed](media/linkedin-learning/data-refresh-selected-table-button.png)

### Incremental Refresh (Optional)

> [!NOTE]
> Before beginning, ensure you have a plan that supports incremental refreshes **Incremental refresh is supported for Power BI Premium, Premium per user, Power BI Pro, and Power BI Embedded models.** [Click Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/incremental-refresh-overview#supported-plans)

Incremental refresh improves update performance and offers several benefits. This refresh method works by defining a data window for data archival, incremental refresh, and real-time data (when supported).

![linkedin-learning-incremental-refresh](media/linkedin-learning/incremental-refresh-one.png)

Additional information on incremental refresh can be found [Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/incremental-refresh-overview)

* Incremental updates are configured table by table and **require editing the query of each table in Power BI Desktop**.

> [!NOTE]
> This process is optional and not required for successful integration with LinkedIn Learning using the Power BI connector.

#### Setting Up Incremental Refresh

To setup the incremental refresh, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the **"Specific table name"**
2. Click **"Edit Query"**

        1. Type: **Date/Time**
        2. Suggested Values: **Any value**
        3. Current Value: **Todays date**
        4. Repeat the same to create the **RangeStart** parameter but ensure that **Current Value** is set to the date from which the data needs to be queried.

![linkedin-learning-manage-parameters-select-option](media/linkedin-learning/manage-parameters-select-option.png)

5. After creating the parameters, move them to the top of the query section.

6. Then, click on the table name and then within applied steps, select **"Source"**.
![linkedin-learning-incremental-data-range-table-select](media/linkedin-learning/incremental-data-range-table-select.png)

7. In the source function, set the parameters as shown: **"= LinkedInLearning.Contents(RangeStart, RangeEnd)"**

![linkedin-learning-source-function-incremental](media/linkedin-learning/source-function-incremental.png)

8. Repeat the process for all data tables, ensuring that the same parameters (**RangeStart** and **RangeEnd**) are set for all sources within the applied steps section for each table.

9. Next, configure the **date range filtering.**

10. In each table or query select **Navigation** within the Applied Steps section.

![linkedin-learning-date-range-filtering](media/linkedin-learning/date-range-filtering.png)

11. Create a **datetime filter**.
    1. Select the dropdown arrow of the "Week column".
    2. Select "Date/Time Filters".
    3. Select "Custom Filter".
    4. Enter values as follows:
        1. Select **Basic**.
        2. Choose **"is after or equal to"**.
        3. Ensure parameter is set, then select **"RangeStart"**.
        4. Select **And**.
        5. Choose **"is before"**.
        6. Ensure parameter is set, then select **"RangeEnd"**.

![linkedin-learning-filtering-date-week-column](media/linkedin-learning/filtering-date-week-column.png)

12. Save and close the Power Query Editor. Please note that this process may take time depending on the number of tables and the date range.

13. The next step is to enable the incremental refresh for each table.

    1. Right-click on the **"Specific table name"**.
    2. Select **"Incremental Refresh"**.
    3. Click **"Incrementally refresh this table"**.
    4. Configure based on preferece.
    5. Click **"Apply"**.

![linkedin-learning-reporting-api-keys-completed](media/linkedin-learning/incremental-refresh-on-each-table.png)

> [!TIP]
> **Archive Data:** Defines the range when you no longer want to see data.
> **Incremental Refresh data:** Defines when data is no longer queried from the API. Ensure incremental refresh is set to no less than 1 month and a maximum of 6 months.

#### Data Columns / JSON

The following columns are used by the data connector and should not be deleted, as doing so may cause errors during data refresh:

* epoch week
* week
* parameters
* total_pages_week
* page_index
* param_w_start
* page_data.paging

Additionally, the column page_data.paging contains the paging information returned by the API.

If you encounter the **"expand"** symbol while editing a query, it indicates that the column can be expanded to show more rows.

![linkedin-learning-data-columns-json](media/linkedin-learning/data-columns-json.png)

Expanding the column **adds a step in the query settings.**

* You can expand as many columns as needed, which will duplicate rows.
* Expanding columns is particularly important for displaying skills in learning assets and custom properties in learner detail reports.

**Congratulations!** Your learning admins can now gain key insights and engagement metrics through their Microsoft Power BI application.
