# FHIR Relationships

This article describes how to establish [relationships](/power-bi/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships) between tables that have been imported using the Power Query connector for FHIR.

## Introduction

FHIR resources are related to each other, for example, an `Observation` that references a subject (`Patient`):

```json
{
    "resourceType": "Observation",
    "id": "1234",
    "subject": {
        "reference": "Patient/456"
    }

    // ... Other fields
}
```

Some of the resource reference fields in FHIR can refer to multiple different types of resources (for example, `Practitioner` or `Organization`). To facilitate an easier way to resolve references, the Power Query connector for FHIR adds a synthetic field to all imported resources called `<referenceId>`, which contains a concatenation of the resource type and the resource ID.

To establish a relationship between two tables, you can connect a specific reference field on a resource to the corresponding `<referenceId>` field on the resource you would like it linked to. In simple cases, Power BI will even detect this for you automatically.

## Establishing FHIR relationships in Power BI

In this section, we'll show an example of establishing a relationship between the `Observation.subject.reference` field and the `<referenceId>` field on `Patient`.

1. When importing data, select the **Patient** and **Observation** tables:

   :::image type="content" source="fhir-navigate-tworesources.png" alt-text="Screenshot with the Patient and Observation tables selected in the Power Query Navigator dialog." lightbox="fhir-navigate-tworesources.png":::

   Then select **Transform Data**.

1. Expand the **subject** column on `Observation` to reveal `subject.reference`:

   :::image type="content" source="fhir-expandsubject.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Power Query editor with the subject column selected and expanded to reveal the columns drop down menu." lightbox="fhir-expandsubject.png":::

   After expanding, you should see the list of subject references:

   :::image type="content" source="fhir-expandedsubjectreference.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Power Query editor showing the new expanded subject references column." lightbox="fhir-expandedsubjectreference.png":::

1. Make any other modifications you need to the query and save the modified query.

1. Select **Manage Relationships** in the Power BI client:

   :::image type="content" source="fhir-managerelationships.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Power Query editor, with the Manage relationships option in the Home tab emphasized." lightbox="fhir-managerelationships.png":::

1. Establish the relationship. In this simple example, Power BI will likely have detected the relationship automatically:

   :::image type="content" source="fhir-relationshipestablished.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Manage relationships dialog, with the relationship automatically detected and displayed." lightbox="fhir-relationshipestablished.png":::

   If not, you can add it manually:

   :::image type="content" source="fhir-newrelationship.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Manage relationships dialog, with no detected relationships, and the new button emphasized." lightbox="fhir-newrelationship.png":::

   You can edit the details of the relationship:

   :::image type="content" source="fhir-editrelationship.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Edit relationships dialog, with the Observation and Patient columns selected." lightbox="fhir-editrelationship.png":::

    :::image type="content" source="fhir-editrelationship.png" alt-text="Edit relationship.":::

## Summary

Resources in FHIR are related. These relationships need to be established on data imported with the Power Query connector for FHIR. The `<referenceId>` field is a synthetic field added to all imported FHIR data that will help establish the relationships.
