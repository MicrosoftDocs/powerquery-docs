## Capabilities supported

* Site URL

## Determine the site URL

When you're connecting to a SharePoint site, you'll be asked to enter the site URL. To find the site URL that contains your SharePoint list, first open a page in SharePoint. From a page in SharePoint, you can usually get the site address by selecting **Home** in the navigation pane, or the icon for the site at the top. Copy the address from your web browser's address bar and save for later.

## Connect to a SharePoint list from Power Query Desktop

To connect to a SharePoint list:

1. From **Get Data**, select **SharePoint List**.

2. Paste the SharePoint site URL you copied in [Determine the site URL](#determine-the-site-url) to the **Site URL** field in the open dialog box.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sharepoint-list/sharepoint-list-url.png" alt-text="Image of the SharePoint lists dialog with the Site URL filled in.":::

   If the URL address you enter is invalid, a :::image type="content" source="./media/sharepoint-list/web-warning.png" alt-text="Warning icon."::: warning icon will appear next to the **Site URL** textbox.

   Select **OK** to continue.

3. If this is the first time you've visited this site address, select the appropriate authentication method. Enter your credentials and chose which level to apply these settings to. Then select **Connect**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sharepoint-list/sharepoint-list-sign-in.png" alt-text="Choose Microsoft account.":::

    For more information about authentication methods and level settings, go to [Authentication with a data source](../connectorauthentication.md).

4. From the **Navigator**, you can select a location, then either transform the data in the Power Query editor by selecting **Transform Data**, or load the data by selecting **Load**.

## Troubleshooting

### Use root SharePoint address

Make sure you supply the root address of the SharePoint site, without any subfolders or documents. For example, use link similar to the following: `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/teams/ObjectModel/`

### Inconsistent behavior around boolean data

When using the SharePoint list connector, Boolean values are represented inconsistently as TRUE/FALSE or 1/0 in Power BI Desktop and Power BI service environments. This may result in wrong data, incorrect filters, and empty visuals.

This issue only happens when the **Data Type** is not explicitly set for a column in the Query View of Power BI Desktop. You can tell that the data type isn't set by seeing the "ABC 123" image on the column and "Any" data type in the ribbon as shown below.

:::image type="content" source="./media/sharepoint-list/boolean-any.png" alt-text="Data type any on a boolean column.":::

The user can force the interpretation to be consistent by explicitly setting the data type for the column through the Power Query Editor. For example, the following image shows the column with an explicit Boolean type.

:::image type="content" source="./media/sharepoint-list/boolean-explicit.png" alt-text="Column with explicit boolean type.":::

### Using OData to access a SharePoint List

If you use an OData feed to access a SharePoint List, there's an approximately 2100 character limitation to the URL you use to connect. More information: [Maximum URL length](odata-feed.md#maximum-url-length)

### Microsoft Entra ID authentication

Microsoft Entra ID authentication isn't supported for on-premises SharePoint sources.
