## Connect using advanced options

Both Power Query Desktop and Power Query Online provide a set of advanced options that you can add to your query if needed.

The following table lists all of the advanced options you can set in Power Query Desktop and Power Query Online.

| Advanced option | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Use Storage Api | A flag that enables using the [Storage API of Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/storage). This option is true by default. This option can be set to false to not use the Storage API and use REST APIs instead. |
| Connection timeout duration | The standard connection setting (in seconds) that controls how long Power Query waits for a connection to complete. You can change this value if your connection doesn't complete before 15 seconds (the default value.) |
| Command timeout duration | How long Power Query waits for a query to complete and return results. The default depends on the driver default. You can enter another value in minutes to keep the connection open longer. |
| Audience Uri | The URI that contains the *\<workforce pool ID>* that must be changed to the workforce-pool name used when setting up the [OIDC configuration](#oidc-configurations). The format for the Audience Uri value is `//iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/<workforce pool ID>/providers/azuread`. The default value for the *\<workforce pool ID>* is `powerquery-<TenantId>`, where *\<TenantId>* is your current Power BI tenant ID. If you update the Audience Uri, the string you enter will be used as-is. |
| ProjectID | The project that you want to run native queries on. This option is only available in Power Query Desktop. |
| Native query | For information, go to [Import data from a database using native database query](../native-database-query.md). In this version of native database query functionality, you need to use fully qualified table names in the format `Database.Schema.Table`, for example `SELECT * FROM DEMO_DB.PUBLIC.DEMO_TABLE`. This option is only available in Power Query Desktop. |

Once you've selected the advanced options you require, select **OK** in Power Query Desktop or **Next** in Power Query Online to connect to your Google BigQuery data.

## Limitations and considerations

This section describes any limitations or considerations of the Google BigQuery (Microsoft Entra ID) connector.

### OIDC configurations

The Google BigQuery (Microsoft Entra ID) connector utilizes Microsoft Entra ID JWT tokens to connect Microsoft Entra ID-based authentication with Google's Workforce Federation feature. So, the setup on the authentication side must be an [OIDC-based set up](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/workforce-pools/providers/create-oidc) to align with the Microsoft Entra ID JWT tokens. Reach out to your Google BigQuery point-of-contact for further information on authentication setup and support on the Google side.

### Connecting to Google BigQuery (Microsoft Entra ID) in Power BI Desktop

There are a few limits and considerations to keep in mind when using the Google BigQuery connector with Power BI.

#### Nested fields

To optimize performance considerations, Google BigQuery does well with large data sets when denormalized, flattened, and nested.

The Google BigQuery (Microsoft Entra ID) connector supports nested fields, which are loaded as text columns in JSON format.

:::image type="content" source="./media/google-bigquery/google-bigquery-nested-fields.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Google BigQuery nested fields support." lightbox="./media/google-bigquery/google-bigquery-nested-fields.png":::

Users should select **Transform Data** and then use the JSON parsing capabilities in the Power Query editor to extract the data.

1. Under the **Transforms** ribbon tab, the **Text Column** category, select **Parse** and then **JSON**.
2. Extract the JSON record fields using the **Expand Column** option.

### Unable to authenticate with Google BigQuery Storage API

The Google BigQuery (Microsoft Entra ID) connector uses [Google BigQuery Storage API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/storage) by default. This feature is controlled by the advanced option called [UseStorageApi](#connect-using-advanced-options). You might encounter issues with this feature if you use granular permissions. In this scenario, you might see the following error message or fail to get any data from your query:

`ERROR [HY000] [Microsoft][BigQuery] (131) Unable to authenticate with Google BigQuery Storage API. Check your account permissions`

You can resolve this issue by adjusting the user permissions for the BigQuery Storage API correctly. These storage API permissions are required to access data correctly with BigQueryStorage API:

* `bigquery.readsessions.create`: Creates a new read session via the BigQuery Storage API.
* `bigquery.readsessions.getData`: Reads data from a read session via the BigQuery Storage API.
* `bigquery.readsessions.update`: Updates a read session via the BigQuery Storage API.

These permissions typically are provided in the `BigQuery.User` role. More information, [Google BigQuery Predefined roles and permissions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control)

If the above steps don't resolve the problem, you can disable the BigQuery Storage API.

### Unable to use DateTime type data in DirectQuery mode

There's a known issue where the DateTime type isn't supported through DirectQuery. Selecting a column with the DateTime type causes an "Invalid query" error or a visual error.

## Enable Microsoft Entra ID single sign-on (SSO) for Google BigQuery

We support Microsoft Entra ID SSO through both Power BI Service (cloud) and also through the on-premises data gateway. For more information about enabling Microsoft Entra ID SSO for all connectors, go to [Overview of single sign-on (SSO) for on-premises data gateways in Power BI](/power-bi/connect-data/service-gateway-sso-overview). Confirm directly with your Google contact that your system and accounts are set up correctly for Microsoft Entra ID SSO prior to attempting to connect in Power BI.

### Microsoft Entra ID single sign-on (SSO) through Power BI service

To configure a new connection in Power BI service:

1. In Power BI service, select **Admin portal** from the settings list.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/google-bigquery/admin-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the setting menu opened, with the Admin portal emphasized.":::

2. Enable the **Google BigQuery SSO** option.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/google-bigquery/gbq-sso.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Google BigQuery SSO option with the Enabled button enabled.":::

### Microsoft Entra ID single sign-on (SSO) for Google BigQuery with an on-premises data gateway

Before you can enable Microsoft Entra ID SSO for Google BigQuery, you must first enable Microsoft Entra ID SSO for all data sources that support Microsoft Entra ID SSO with an on-premises data gateway. Also, ensure you've upgraded to at least the December 2022 release of the on-premises data gateway:

1. In Power BI service, select **Admin portal** from the settings list.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/google-bigquery/admin-portal.png" alt-text="Another screenshot of the Settings menu with the Admin portal emphasized.":::

2. Under **Integration settings**, enable **Azure AD Single-Sign On (SSO) for Gateway**.

Once you've enabled Microsoft Entra ID SSO for all data sources, then enable Microsoft Entra ID SSO for Google BigQuery:

1. Enable the **Google BigQuery SSO** option.

2. Select **Manage gateways** from the settings list.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/google-bigquery/manage-gateways.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Settings menu with Manage gateways emphasized.":::

3. Select a gateway, and then select **Choose Data Source**.

4. Under the **Data Source Settings** tab, enter a value in **Billing Project ID**. The **Billing Project ID** parameter is required when using Microsoft Entra ID and needs to be specified in **Advanced settings**. Also, select **Use SSO via Azure AD for DirectQuery queries**.
