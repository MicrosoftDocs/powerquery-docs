## Prerequisites

You must have a SumTotal hosted environment with standard permissions to access the portal, and read permissions to access data in tables.

## Capabilities supported

* Import
* Query Multiple OData endpoints
* Advanced
  * Optionally filter records by RowVersionId parameter to get incremental data

## Finding your SumTotal hosted URL

Copy the SumTotal hosted root URL in full. This root URL is the unique URL specific to your instance. The URL will be in the format of `https://<*yourcustomerdomain*>.sumtotal.host/`. Make sure not to copy the rest of the URL. Keep this URL somewhere handy so you can use it later.

## Known issues and limitations

This section describes any issues or limitations associated with the SumTotal connector.

### SumTotal OData API performance and throttling limits

For information about OData API performance and throttling limits for SumTotal connections, go to [SumTotal's OData API functionality](https://marketplace.sumtotalsystems.com/Home/ODataAPI) under the **Important Notes** section. These limitations apply to both the SumTotal connector (which uses the OData API as an implementation detail) and the 'actual' OData Hosted API when accessing the same endpoints.

### Table retrieval rate

As a guideline, most default tables are retrieved at approximately 1000 rows per second using the SumTotal connector. If you require faster retrieval rates, consider using the **RowVersionId** filter parameter. You can pass this parameter directly to the environment hosted URL by appending it as a query string parameter. Full URL example with **rowVersionId** parameter: `https://{host}.sumtotalystems.com/?rowVersionId=1234`.
