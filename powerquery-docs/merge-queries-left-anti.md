# Left anti join

One of the join kinds available in the **Merge** dialog box in Power Query is a *left anti join*, which brings in only rows from the left table that don't have any matching rows from the right table. More information: [Merge operations overview](merge-queries-overview.md)

   Figure shows a table on the left with Date, CountryID, and Units columns. The emphasized CountryID column contains values of 1 in rows 1 and 2, 3 in row 3, and 2 in row 4. A table on the right contains ID and Country columns. The emphasized ID column contains values of 3 in row 1 (denoting Panama) and 4 in row 2 (denoting Spain). A table below the first two tables contains Date, CountryID, Units, and Country columns. The table has three rows, with two rows containing the data for CountryID 1, and one row for CountryID 2. Since none of the remaining CountryIDs match any of the countries in the right table, the rows in the Country column in the merged table all contain null.

This article uses sample data to show how to do a merge operation with the left anti join. The sample source tables for this example are:

* **Sales**: This table includes the fields **Date**, **CountryID**, and **Units**. **CountryID** is a whole number value that represents the unique identifier from the **Countries** table.

   ![Sales table containing Date, CountryID, and Units columns, with CountryID set to 1 in rows 1 and 2, 3 in row 3, and 2 in row 4.](media/merge-queries-left-anti/left-anti-sales-table.png "Sales table containing Date, CountryID, and Units columns, with CountryID set to 1 in rows 1 and 2, 3 in row 3, and 2 in row 4")

* **Countries**: This table is a reference table with the fields **id** and **Country**. The **id** field represents the unique identifier for each record.

   ![Countries table with id set to 3 in row 1 and 4 in row 2 and Country set to Panama in row 1 and Spain in row 2.](media/merge-queries-left-anti/left-anti-countries-table.png "Countries table with id set to 3 in row 1 and 4 in row 2 and Country set to Panama in row 1 and Spain in row 2")

In this example, you'll merge both tables, with the **Sales** table as the left table and the **Countries** table as the right one. The join will be made between the following columns.

|Field from the Sales table| Field from the Countries table|
|-----------|------------------|
|CountryID|id|

The goal is to create a table like the following, where only the rows from the left table that don't match any from the right table are kept.

**To do a left anti join**
<!--markdownlint-enable MD036-->
1. Select the **Sales** query, and then select **Merge queries**.
2. In the **Merge** dialog box, under **Right table for merge**, select **Countries**.
3. In the **Sales** table, select the **CountryID** column.
4. In the **Countries** table, select the **id** column.
5. In the **Join kind** section, select **Left anti**.
6. Select **OK**.

>[!TIP]
>Take a closer look at the message at the bottom of the dialog box that reads "The selection excludes 1 of 4 rows from the first table." This message is crucial to understanding the result that you get from this operation.

In the **Sales** table, you have a **CountryID** of 1 and 2, but neither of them are found in the **Countries** table. That's why the match only found one of four rows in the left (first) table.

In the **Countries** table, you have the **Country** Spain with an **id** of 4, but there are no records for **CountryID** 4 in the **Sales** table. That's why only one of two rows from the right (second) table found a match.

From the newly created **Countries** column, expand the **Country** field. Don't select the **Use original column name as prefix** check box.

![Expand table column for Country.](media/merge-queries-left-anti/left-anti-expand-field.png "Expand table column for Country")

After doing this operation, you'll create a table that looks like the following image. The newly expanded **Country** field doesn't have any values. That's because the left anti join doesn't bring any values from the right table&mdash;it only keeps rows from the left table.
