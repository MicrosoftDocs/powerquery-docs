# Power Query SDK test framework part 2 - Test data

This multi-part reference covers the setup and running of a standard suite of tests for Power Query connector developers. The reference is meant to be followed sequentially to ensure that your environment is set-up for testing your extension connector.

In this section, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Learn about the dataset used in the standard suite of the tests
> * Download a copy of the test data
> * Upload the data to your choice of database for the connector you intend to test

This section covers the test data that is used by the test suite to verify your connector.

## Overview of the dataset

The test data used for the framework is a modified version of the [NewYork City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) green trip record data.

The February 2023 green trip data was converted into "NycTaxiGreen" CSV file and 10,000 rows were sampled from it. Similarly, the "TaxiZoneLookup" CSV file contains 265 rows from the taxi zone lookup table.
CSV data format was chosen due to its large applicability to nearly all other data sources, making it easier to import.

The definition for each field might be slightly different from the information found in [NYC Taxi and Limousine green dataset - Azure Open Datasets](/azure/open-datasets/dataset-taxi-green?tabs=azureml-opendatasets) and [data_dictionary_trip_records_green.pdf (nyc.gov)](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_green.pdf).

The dataset for our testing is split into two csv files: [NycTaxiGreen](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/testframework/data/nyc_taxi_tripdata.csv) and [TaxiZoneLookup](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/testframework/data/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv).

### Getting the test data

The test data is placed in the [Data Connectors git repo](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/testframework/data/). Test data is provided in the form of CSV along with the [schema definition](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/testframework/data/PQSDKTestFrameworkDataSchema.sql) for the [NycTaxiGreen](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/testframework/data/nyc_taxi_tripdata.csv) and [TaxiZoneLookup](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/testframework/data/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv) tables. This data should be loaded to your data source as separate tables and you need to ensure that the schema corresponds to the datatypes defined in your data source.

> [!NOTE]
> While uploading to the data source, all decimal values should have a **scale of 2**. That is, the number of digits after the decimal point should be 2.
> All timestamp values should be uploaded to the datasouce in `MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS` format.
