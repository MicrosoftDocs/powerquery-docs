## Install Power Query SDK extension

The Power Query SDK test framework comes bundled with [Power Query SDK for Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/powerquerysdk). Follow the steps in [Installing the PowerQuery SDK](./../install-sdk.md#installing-the-power-query-sdk) to get it set up for Visual Studio Code.

## Locate the Power Query SDK for Visual Studio Code install directory

Install the Power Query SDK for Visual Studio Code and use it to create a new connector project, or open an existing project. On first use, the SDK downloads the latest "Microsoft.PowerQuery.SdkTools" NuGet to the extension's cache folder.

The default location of the extension folder is:

%UserProfile%\.vscode\extensions\powerquery.vscode-powerquery-sdk-*x.x.x*-win32-x64

Where "*x.x.x*" is the current version of Power Query SDK extension

The SdkTools NuGet package is found under:

\<*extension_path*>\.nuget\Microsoft.PowerQuery.SdkTools.2.*xxx.x*\tools

Where "*xxx.x*" is the current version of Power Query SDK Tools

If you don't have a ".nuget" folder, be sure to load a connector workspace in Visual Studio Code to trigger the SDK's autodownload mechanism. The SdkTools NuGet contains the Power Query SDK test framework.
