# Automatically retry a dataflow on failure

In the scenario where you want to automatically retry a dataflow when the refresh fails, the Power Automate Connector is probably the way to go. In this tutorial, we'll guide you step by step in setting up your Power Automate flow.

To automatically retry a dataflow on failure:

1. Navigate to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).
2. Select **Create** > **Automated cloud flow**.
3. Enter a flow name, and then search for the **When a dataflow refresh completes** connector. Select this connector from the list, and then select **Create**.
4. Customize the connector. Enter the following information on your dataflow:

   1. **Group Type**: Select **Environment** if you're connecting to Power Apps and **Workspace** if you're connecting to Power BI.
   2. **Group**: Select the Power Apps environment or the Power BI workspace your dataflow is in.
   3. **Dataflow**: Select your dataflow by name.

5. Select **New step** to add an action to your flow.
6. Search for the **Condition** connector, and then select it.
7. Customize the **Condition** connector. Enter the following information:

   1. In the first cell, add **Refresh Status** from the dataflow connector.
   2. Leave the second cell as **is equal to**.
   3. In the third cell, enter **Failed**.

8. In the **If Yes** section, select **Add an action**.
9. Search for the **Refresh a dataflow** connector, and then select it.
10. Customize the connector:

    1. **Group Type**: Select **Environment** if you're connecting to Power Apps and **Workspace** if you're connecting to Power BI.
    2. **Group**: Select the Power Apps environment or the Power BI workspace your dataflow is in.
    3. **Dataflow**: Select the same dataflow as chosen in step 4.
