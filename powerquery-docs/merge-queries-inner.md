# Inner join

One of the join kinds available in the **Merge** dialog box in Power Query is an *inner join*, which brings in only matching rows from both the left and right tables. More information: [Merge operations overview](merge-queries-overview.md)

   Figure shows the left table with Date, CountryID, and Units columns. The emphasized CountryID column contains values of 1 in rows 1 and 2, 3 in row 3, and 2 in row 4. The right table contains ID and Country columns. The emphasized ID column contains values of 3 in row 1 (denoting Panama) and 4 in row 2 (denoting Spain). A table below the first two tables contains Date, CountryID, Units, and Country columns, but only one row of data for Panama.

This article uses sample data to show how to do a merge operation with the inner join. The sample source tables for this example are:

* **Sales**: This table includes the fields **Date**, **CountryID**, and **Units**. **CountryID** is a whole number value that represents the unique identifier from the **Countries** table.

  :::image type="content" source="media/merge-queries-inner/inner-join-sales-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sales table containing Date, CountryID, and Units columns, with CountryID set to 1 in rows 1 and 2, 3 in row 3, and 2 in row 4.":::

* **Countries**: This table is a reference table with the fields **ID** and **Country**. The **ID** field represents the unique identifier for each record.

  :::image type="content" source="media/merge-queries-inner/inner-join-countries-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the countries table with ID set to 3 in row 1 and 4 in row 2 and Country set to Panama in row 1 and Spain in row 2.":::

In this example, you merge both tables, with the **Sales** table as the left table and the **Countries** table as the right one. The join is made between the following columns.

|Field from the Sales table| Field from the Countries table|
|-----------|------------------|
|CountryID|ID|

The goal is to create a table like the following, where the name of the country appears as a new **Country** column in the **Sales** table. Because of how the inner join works, only matching rows from both the left and right tables are brought in.

To perform an inner join:

1. Select the **Sales** query, and then select **Merge queries**.
2. In the **Merge** dialog box, under **Right table for merge**, select **Countries**.
3. In the **Sales** table, select the **CountryID** column.
4. In the **Countries** table, select the **ID** column.
5. In the **Join kind** section, select **Inner**.
6. Select **OK**.

> [!TIP]
>Take a closer look at the message at the bottom of the dialog box that reads "The selection matches 1 rows from both the tables." This message is crucial to understanding the result that you get from this operation.

In the **Sales** table, you have a **CountryID** of 1 and 2, but neither of these values are found in the **Countries** table. Therefore, the match only found one of four rows in the left (first) table.

In the **Countries** table, you have the **Country** Spain with the **ID** 4, but there are no records for a **CountryID** of 4 in the **Sales** table. Therefore, only one of two rows from the right (second) table found a match.

From the newly created **Countries** column, expand the **Country** field. Don't select the **Use original column name as prefix** check box.

After performing this operation, the resulting table looks like the following image.
