# Inner join

One of the join kinds available in the **Merge** dialog box in Power Query is an *inner join*, which brings in only matching rows from both the left and right tables. More information: [Merge operations overview](merge-queries-overview.md)

:::image type="complex" source="media/merge-queries-inner/inner-join-operation.png" alt-text="Inner join example.":::
   Figure shows a table on the left with Date, CountryID, and Units columns. The emphasized CountryID column contains values of 1 in rows 1 and 2, 3 in row 3, and 2 in row 4. A table on the right contains ID and Country columns. The emphasized ID column contains values of 3 in row 1 (denoting Panama) and 4 in row 2 (denoting Spain). A table below the first two tables contains Date, CountryID, Units, and Country columns, but only one row of data for Panama.

This article uses sample data to show how to do a merge operation with the inner join. The sample source tables for this example are:

* **Sales**: This table includes the fields **Date**, **CountryID**, and **Units**. **CountryID** is a whole number value that represents the unique identifier from the **Countries** table.

   ![Sales table containing Date, CountryID, and Units columns, with CountryID set to 1 in rows 1 and 2, 3 in row 3, and 2 in row 4.](media/merge-queries-inner/inner-join-sales-table.png "Sales table containing Date, CountryID, and Units columns, with CountryID set to 1 in rows 1 and 2, 3 in row 3, and 2 in row 4")

* **Countries**: This is a reference table with the fields **id** and **Country**. The **id** field represents the unique identifier for each record.

   ![Countries table with id set to 3 in row 1 and 4 in row 2 and Country set to Panama in row 1 and Spain in row 2.](media/merge-queries-inner/inner-join-countries-table.png "Countries table with id set to 3 in row 1 and 4 in row 2 and Country set to Panama in row 1 and Spain in row 2")

In this example, you'll merge both tables, with the **Sales** table as the left table and the **Countries** table as the right one. The join will be made between the following columns.

|Field from the Sales table| Field from the Countries table|
|-----------|------------------|
|CountryID|id|

The goal is to create a table like the following, where the name of the country appears as a new **Country** column in the **Sales** table. Because of how the inner join works, only matching rows from both the left and right tables will be brought in.

**To perform an inner join**
<!--markdownlint-enable MD036-->
1. Select the **Sales** query, and then select **Merge queries**.
2. In the **Merge** dialog box, under **Right table for merge**, select **Countries**.
3. In the **Sales** table, select the **CountryID** column.
4. In the **Countries** table, select the **id** column.
5. In the **Join kind** section, select **Inner**.
6. Select **OK**.

>[!TIP]
>Take a closer look at the message at the bottom of the dialog box that reads "The selection matches 1 of 4 rows from the first table, and 1 of 2 rows from the second table." This message is crucial to understanding the result that you get from this operation.

In the **Sales** table, you have a **CountryID** of 1 and 2, but neither of these values are found in the **Countries** table. That's why the match only found one of four rows in the left (first) table.

In the **Countries** table, you have the **Country** Spain with the **id** 4, but there are no records for a **CountryID** of 4 in the **Sales** table. That's why only one of two rows from the right (second) table found a match.

From the newly created **Countries** column, expand the **Country** field. Don't select the **Use original column name as prefix** check box.

After performing this operation, you'll create a table that looks like the following image.

![Final table with Date, CountryID, Units, and Country column headers, and a single row of data for the country Panama.](media/merge-queries-inner/inner-final-table-2.png "Final table with Date, CountryID, Units, and Country column headers, and a single row of data for the country Panama")
